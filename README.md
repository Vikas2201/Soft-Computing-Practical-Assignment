# Soft-Computing-Practical-Assignment
--------------------------------------------------------

Soft Computing is the fusion of methodologies designed to model and enable solutions to real world problems, which are not modeled or too difficult to model mathematically.

The aim of Soft Computing is to exploit the tolerance for imprecision, uncertainty, approximate reasoning, and partial truth in order to achieve close resemblance with human like decision making.

The Soft Computing consists of several computing paradigms mainly : Fuzzy Systems, Neural Networks, and Genetic Algorithms.
 
  • Fuzzy set : for knowledge representation via fuzzy If – Then rules.
  
  • Neural Networks : for learning and adaptation
  
  • Genetic Algorithms : for evolutionary computation

# Fuzzy Computing
------------------------------------

In the real world there exists much fuzzy knowledge, that is, knowledge which is vague, imprecise, uncertain, ambiguous, inexact, or probabilistic in nature.

# Neural Network
-------------------------

A neural network is constructed from several interconnected nodes called “neurons”.  Neurons are arranged into the input layer, hidden layer, and output layer. The input layer corresponds to our predictors/features and the Output layer to our response variable/s.

# Genetic Algorithms
----------------------------------------

Genetic algorithms (GAs) are a part of evolutionary computing, a rapidly growing area of artificial intelligence. GAs are inspired by Darwin's theory about evolution - "survival of the fittest".
